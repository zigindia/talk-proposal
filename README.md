# Proposals

To propose a talk for a future meetup, open an issue on this repository.
Feel free to propose a talk even if there is no scheduled meetup.
We'll go over the proposals before each meetup and select the ones that best fit the schedule.

## Guidelines
- **Subject**: We try to stick to Zig, but general talks about systems are welcome too.
- **Duration**
	- **Talks about Zig**: Ideally ≤ 30 minutes, but in-depth talks can take longer if needed.
	- **Talks about Systems**: 20–25 minutes.
	- **Lightning talk**: Between 10–15 minutes.
- **Content**: No strict rules here. It can be a slide deck, a live-coding sprint, or both, or neither.

Talks that are shorter and on-topic are easier to fit within the schedule.
